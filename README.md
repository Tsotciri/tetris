A simple copy of the tetris made in C (C99) as a project to experiment with the language

Currently only works in Windows 11

NOTE: I plan to also update the code so it supports linux, uses structs and also add more features like animations, score, etc. 
## Compile 
`gcc main.c tetris.h arrays.h -o main`
